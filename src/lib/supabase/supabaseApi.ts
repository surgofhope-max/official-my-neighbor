/**
 * Supabase API Alias
 *
 * TEMPORARY FILE during Base44 → Supabase migration.
 *
 * This file exists solely to provide a consistent import path for the
 * canonical Supabase client. Once all Base44 references are removed,
 * consumers should import directly from "@/lib/supabase/supabaseClient".
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/supabaseApi";
 *
 * After migration is complete, this file can be deleted.
